I need to create a user anita with a non-interactive shell (like /sbin/nologin) on App Server 3 (stapp03).

# Step 1: SSH into App Server 3

ssh banner@stapp03

# password: BigGr33n

# Step 2: Create the user 'anita' with a non-interactive shell

sudo useradd -s /sbin/nologin anita

# Step 3: Verify the user and shell

getent passwd anita

âœ… Expected output for the last command should look something like:
anita:x:1002:1002::/home/anita:/sbin/nologin

ðŸ‘‰::::: My Explanation ::::::

Weâ€™re creating a system user (anita) that tools (like the backup agent) can use, but humans cannot log in and run commands with.
This improves security and ensures the user is used only for its intended purpose.

sudo useradd -s /sbin/nologin anita

useradd â†’ command to create a new user.

-s /sbin/nologin â†’ tells Linux what shell the user should use.

Normally, when you create a user, it gets a shell like /bin/bash.
That means the user can log in, run commands, etc.
But here, we donâ€™t want anita to log in and run commands.
So we give them a non-interactive shell: /sbin/nologin.

Non-interactive shell =
The user account exists (for authentication, running background processes, or tools like backup agents), but if someone tries to log in as that user, theyâ€™ll get a message like:
This account is currently not available.

and then disconnected.
This is a security measure:
Some users are meant only for services or automated tools, not for humans to log in.
It prevents someone from exploiting that account to open a real shell.
