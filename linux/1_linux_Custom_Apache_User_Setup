This task is about creating a custom Apache user for security purposes. You need to:

Log into App Server 3 (stapp03).
Create a user named yousuf with:
UID = 1605
Home directory = /var/www/yousuf

# Step 1: SSH into App Server 3
ssh banner@stapp03
# password: BigGr33n

# Step 2: Create the user 'yousuf' with UID 1605 and home directory /var/www/yousuf
sudo useradd -u 1605 -d /var/www/yousuf -m yousuf

# Step 3: Verify user details
getent passwd yousuf


âœ… Expected verification:
When you run:
getent passwd yousuf
yousuf:x:1605:1605::/var/www/yousuf:/bin/bash


ðŸ‘‰::::: My Explanation ::::::

This confirms:
Username = yousuf
UID = 1605
Home = /var/www/yousuf
Default shell = /bin/bash (since no special shell was set)


here -> sudo useradd -u 1605 -d /var/www/yousuf -m yousuf
yousuf â†’ the new username we want to create.
-u 1605 â†’ set the User ID (UID) to 1605. Each user in Linux has a number (UID) behind the scenes.
-d /var/www/yousuf â†’ tells Linux that the home folder for this user is /var/www/yousuf.
-m â†’ make sure that home folder is created if it doesnâ€™t exist.


# Why are we doing this?
The company wants custom Apache users for each application.
Instead of running everything as one big user (like apache or www-data), we give each app its own user.
This way, if one app gets hacked, the attacker only gets access to that appâ€™s user, not the whole system.
Itâ€™s a security best practice.
