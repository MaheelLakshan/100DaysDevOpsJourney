The goal is to install git on the Storage Server (ststor01) and create a bare repository called /opt/games.git.

From the jump host, connect to the Storage Server:
ssh natasha@ststor01
Bl@kW

<!-- Install git with yum -->
On the Storage Server, run:
sudo yum install -y git

<!-- Create the bare repository -->
A bare repo is different from a normal repo:
A normal repo has a working directory (you can edit files).
A bare repo only contains the .git data (meant for sharing/pushing).
To create it:
sudo mkdir -p /opt/games.git
cd /opt/games.git
sudo git init --bare

<!-- Verify the repo -->
cd /opt/games.git
ls


‚úÖ Expected verification:
branches  config  description  HEAD  hooks  info  objects  refs

üëâ::::: My Explanation ::::::

<!-- Why do we install git on the server? -->
Think of git as a tool (like MS Word is for writing docs, git is for managing code).
To store code on a server, the server must have git installed.
Without git, the server wouldn‚Äôt know how to handle pushes/pulls from developers.

<!-- What is a bare repository? -->
Normally, when you make a git project on your laptop, it has code files + a hidden .git folder.
But on a central server, we don‚Äôt want editable files, we only want a central storage place for the code.
That‚Äôs why we create a bare repo ‚Üí it has only the .git part (no working code files).

<!-- What .git means -->

When you see a folder or file ending with .git, it usually refers to a Git repository.
.git folder ‚Üí contains all the metadata, history, branches, commits, and configuration for a git project.
It does not contain the editable code files in a bare repository.
Essentially, .git = the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù of a git repository.
